### Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5

While the introduction to HTML wasn't particularly difficult, I enjoy that it is easier to understand and write at first when compared to C#. The one habit I do have is that I tend to get ahead of myself when reading the lessons, or thinking "Ha, I know this already!" which leads to my code not working. 

### Basic CSS

I have taken the most notes with this module so far. I nested style code with other nests by accident a few times so I have learned to read my code a little more closely before executing. It was interesting to learn that Internet Explorer doesn't agree with many CSS elements and gave insight into how you have to take all web browsers into consideration when coding.

### CSS Grid
**Use grid-area Without Creating an Areas Template**
I had a little bit of difficulty with this lesson. I didn't understand how to create an area using the grid-area property until I drew the grid from a previous lesson.
