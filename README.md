### Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5

While the introduction to HTML wasn't particularly difficult, I enjoy that it is easier to understand and write at first when compared to C#. The one habit I do have is that I tend to get ahead of myself when reading the lessons, or thinking "Ha, I know this already!" which leads to my code not working. 

### Basic CSS

I have taken the most notes with this module so far. I nested style code with other nests by accident a few times so I have learned to read my code a little more closely before executing. It was interesting to learn that Internet Explorer doesn't agree with many CSS elements and gave insight into how you have to take all web browsers into consideration when coding.

### CSS Grid
**Use grid-area Without Creating an Areas Template**

I had a little bit of difficulty with this lesson. I didn't understand how to create an area using the grid-area property until I drew the grid from a previous lesson.

### Intro to JavaScript
**Basic JavaScript: Stand in Line**

This lesson was difficult when trying to recall what I learned from memory as I do with most lessons. I had to refer to my notes to pass this lesson, but it makes me grateful that I did write down previous lessons. I am learning that relying on memory isn't always the best method when working on code.

**Basic JavaScript: Testing Objects for Properties**

Trying to follow examples in these later lessons, or at least referring to them has proven difficult. There were no if statements in this example so when my code threw errors it confused me until I watched the video. I'm not sure if my notes aren't clear/good enough, or if a certain way of thinking hasn't clicked for me yet. 


**Basic JavaScript: Iterate with JavaScript While Loops**

This lesson tricked me a little bit. I set my while loop up fine, but was caught off guard when they wanted the sequence to be backwards. I had to think about it for a moment after checking my notes and ended up using .reverse to pass the lesson. I don't remember that being spoken about in previous lessons so it felt good to solve my problem on my own. Another way I did it was assigning my var i a value of 5.

### Intro to ES6 challenges

**Use Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters**

I struggled with this lesson because it didn't make sense how to pass max and min into my argument at first. I wrote my code and studied what was in the console before reading a hint and peeked at the solution on how to solve it. Sometimes I overthink what I'm doing and complicate it more than needed for myself.
